My name is Dzmitry Bahdanau (Dima is the preferred short version) and this is
my professional webpage and blog. It is currently under construction, so please
tolerate its rather boring looks.

I am a second-year PhD candidate at the famous [Montreal Institute of Learning
Algorithms](http://www.mila.umontreal.ca/) working under supervision of Yoshua
Bengio. I am passionate about making progress towards useful intelligent systems
that mostly learn on their own with little human involvement and task-specific engineering.
My attidude to research is a mix of an engineer's desire to build something helpful and
of a scientist's wish to find the most basic and generic principles of learning and intelligence.

A big of bragging: I invented the 
[content-based neural attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) that is nowadays widely used in 
machine learning, primarily in machine translation (also developed concurrently 
in the context of [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) and 
[Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916).
