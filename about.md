My name is Dzmitry Bahdanau and this is my professional webpage and blog. It 
is currently under construction, so please tolerate its rather boring looks.

I am a first-year PhD candidate at the famous [Montreal Institute of Learning
Algorithms](http://www.mila.umontreal.ca/) working under supervision of Yoshua
Bengio. I focus on the problem of structured prediction, which is an umbrella
term for many problems that amount  to learning a transformation from a
structured input to a structured output.  Examples of structured prediction
tasks include machine translation, speech recognition, text summarization and
many others.  While these tasks are often studied in separate disciplines, I
think it makes a lot of sense to have a unified perspective and aim for
broadly-applicable generic methods.
