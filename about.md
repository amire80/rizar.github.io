My name is Dzmitry Bahdanau (Dima is the preferred short version) and this is
my professional webpage and blog. It is currently under construction, so please
tolerate its rather boring looks.

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the famous [Montreal Institute of Learning
Algorithms](http://www.mila.umontreal.ca/) working under supervision of Yoshua
Bengio. My long term research goal is organic human-computer interaction in natural language:
think explaining your graphic design or spreadsheet software what you want,
think giving language commands to your robot. This direction is often called _grounded language
understanding_ these days. Prior to focusing on this direction I worked
of machine comprehension, speech recognition and machine translation.

A bit of bragging: I invented the 
[content-based neural attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) that is nowadays widely used in 
machine learning, primarily in machine translation (also developed concurrently 
in the context of [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) and 
[Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916).
